Yes they make sense. Age, fare, pclass, and sex, we have found through other work with the Titanic dataset are very good predictors of survivability.

## Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
Yes everything is clearly thought out and explained, whether it was in markdown cells, code comments, or reflections.

## Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
yes, but his findings were more just him describing his process for the better part of it.
